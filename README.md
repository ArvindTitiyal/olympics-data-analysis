### Project Overview

 ## Problem Statement
The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.

Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of the Olympic Games.
